# Changelog

All notable changes to StackStudio are documented in this file.

## [3.0.0] - 2025-01-13 - Production Ready Release

### ‚úÖ Major Achievements

#### Database Population Complete
- **Massive expansion**: From 2 to 63 comprehensive tools (3150% increase)
- **Categories covered**: Coding tools, AI platforms, no-code/low-code, deployment, databases
- **Rich metadata**: Pricing models, compatibility matrices, pros/cons, learning curves

#### SSR Issues Completely Resolved
- **Root cause eliminated**: Server-side rendering trying to execute browser-only code
- **Solution implemented**: Comprehensive `isClient` pattern across all auth-dependent components
- **Components fixed**: Dashboard, AuthButton, StackFastApp with SSR-safe patterns
- **Pages optimized**: Dynamic imports with `{ ssr: false }` for auth-dependent pages

#### Build Pipeline Optimized
- **TypeScript errors**: All user property compatibility issues resolved (NextAuth integration)
- **Test files**: Cleaned up and excluded from build process
- **Workflow timeouts**: Added to prevent hanging builds
- **Environment variables**: Properly configured for CI/CD

#### Infrastructure Improvements
- **New Relic removal**: Eliminated problematic 740GB log file consuming disk space
- **Repository cleanup**: Removed 50+ duplicate documentation files
- **Workflow optimization**: Single clean deployment workflow with proper timeouts
- **Disk space recovery**: Freed up 770GB+ of storage space

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

#### Authentication & User Management
- **NextAuth integration**: Complete GitHub OAuth implementation
- **User property consistency**: Standardized `user.email`, `user.name`, `user.image`
