### üìù **Pre-Recording Checklist**

#### **Environment Setup:**
- [ ] Dev server running (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Clean browser state (incognito/private mode)
- [ ] Close unnecessary tabs and windows
- [ ] Disable notifications and popups
- [ ] Test the complete flow manually first

#### **Recording Tool Setup:**
- [ ] Choose your tool (I recommend ScreenToGif for Windows)
- [ ] Set recording area to browser window
- [ ] Test recording quality and frame rate
- [ ] Check audio is off (GIF doesn't need sound)

#### **Content Preparation:**
- [ ] Have project idea ready: "AI-powered SaaS dashboard"
- [ ] Know which tools to select quickly
- [ ] Practice the flow 2-3 times before recording
- [ ] Clear any existing projects from dashboard

### üõ†Ô∏è **Recommended Recording Tools**

#### **For Windows (Recommended):**
**ScreenToGif** - Free, perfect for this use case
- Download: https://www.screentogif.com/
- Settings: 15 FPS, High quality
- Built-in editor for optimization

#### **Alternative Options:**
- **LICEcap** (Cross-platform): https://www.cockos.com/licecap/

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Optimal GIF Settings**

```
Resolution: 1000x700 (or 1200x800 if file size allows)
Frame Rate: 15 FPS (smooth but efficient)
Duration: 12-15 seconds
File Size Target: <3MB (for GitHub compatibility)
Colors: Optimized (reduce palette if needed)
Dithering: Minimal (keeps file size down)
```

### üéØ **Recording Tips**

1. **Practice First**: Do 2-3 dry runs to get timing right
2. **Steady Hands**: Use smooth, deliberate mouse movements
3. **Good Pacing**: Don't rush - let users absorb each step
4. **Show Success**: Make sure success states are visible
5. **End Strong**: Final frame should show completed project

### üì± **Mobile Consideration**
Since your app is responsive, consider creating a second GIF showing mobile view:
- Same flow but on smaller screen
- Show responsive design in action
- Great for showcasing mobile-first approach

### üöÄ **Post-Recording Optimization**

1. **Trim precisely** - Cut any dead time at start/end
2. **Optimize file size** - Use tool's compression features
3. **Test playback** - Ensure smooth looping
4. **Check readability** - All text should be clear
5. **Verify file size** - Must be under 3MB for GitHub

### üì§ **Upload Strategy**

#### **GitHub Releases (Recommended):**
1. Create a new release in your repo
2. Upload GIF as release asset
3. Use direct GitHub URL in README
4. Example: `https://github.com/user/repo/releases/download/v1.0/demo.gif`

#### **Alternative Hosting:**
- **Imgur**: Free, reliable, direct links
- **GitHub Issues**: Upload to issue, copy URL (clever hack!)
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Host with your deployment
