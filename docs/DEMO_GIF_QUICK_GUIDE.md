# StackFast Demo GIF - Quick Practice Guide

## üéØ **Before You Record**

### 1. **Download Recording Tool**
I recommend **ScreenToGif** for Windows:
- Download: https://www.screentogif.com/
- It's free, lightweight, and perfect for this
- Has built-in editing and optimization

### 2. **Practice Run Checklist**
Run through this flow 2-3 times before recording:

```
‚úÖ Start at homepage
‚úÖ Show SSR instant loading (no blank page!)
‚úÖ Click "Sign in with GitHub"
‚úÖ Navigate to "Create New Blueprint"
‚úÖ Enter project: "AI-powered SaaS dashboard"
‚úÖ Select skill: "Intermediate"
‚úÖ Choose tools: React, Firebase, Vercel (quickly)
‚úÖ Click "Generate Blueprint"
‚úÖ Show AI thinking + results
‚úÖ Scroll to GitHub section
‚úÖ Click "Create GitHub Repository"
‚úÖ Show success message
‚úÖ End on beautiful dashboard view
```

### 3. **Recording Setup**

**Browser Window:**
- Use Chrome or Edge in **incognito mode**
- Set window size to about **1200x800 pixels**
- **Zoom level: 100%** (or 110% for better text readability)
- Close all other tabs and windows

**ScreenToGif Settings:**
- **Frame rate**: 15 FPS
- **Recording area**: Select the browser window
- **Quality**: High (we'll optimize later)

### 4. **The Perfect 15-Second Script**

| Time | Action | What User Sees |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 0-2s | Homepage loads instantly | Professional SSR loading |
| 2-3s | Click "Sign In" | Smooth navigation |
| 3-4s | Click "Create New Blueprint" | Dashboard overview |
| 4-7s | Quick wizard: idea + skill + tools | Smooth form interaction |
| 7-9s | Click "Generate" + AI loading | Exciting AI at work! |
| 9-11s | Results appear + cost projection | Amazing recommendations |
| 11-13s | Click "Create GitHub Repo" | GitHub integration |
| 13-15s | Success + final dashboard | Beautiful completion |

### 5. **Mouse Movement Tips**

- **Smooth, deliberate movements** - no rushed clicking
- **Hover briefly** before clicking (shows interactivity)
- **Direct paths** between elements
- **Let animations complete** before moving on

### 6. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**

‚ùå **Too fast** - Users need time to absorb each step  
‚ùå **Jerky mouse movements** - Looks unprofessional  
‚ùå **Cutting off animations** - Let the UI complete its transitions  
‚ùå **Too long** - Keep it under 15 seconds total  
‚ùå **Poor text visibility** - Make sure all text is readable  

### 7. **Post-Recording Optimization**

**In ScreenToGif editor:**
1. **Trim** start/end frames for perfect timing
2. **Reduce colors** if file size is too big
3. **Optimize** using built-in tools
4. **Target file size**: Under 3MB for GitHub
5. **Test playback** to ensure smooth looping

### 8. **Upload to GitHub**

**Option 1: GitHub Releases (Recommended)**
1. Go to your repo ‚Üí Releases
2. Click "Create a new release"
3. Tag: `v1.0-demo` 
4. Upload your GIF as an asset
5. Copy the direct URL to use in README

**Option 2: GitHub Issues (Quick)**
1. Create a new issue in your repo
2. Drag and drop the GIF
3. Copy the GitHub URL it generates
4. You can close the issue after

### 9. **README Integration**

Replace the placeholder in your README:
```markdown

*Complete project creation workflow in 15 seconds*
```

## üöÄ **Ready to Record?**

1. **Run setup script**: `setup-demo.bat` (Windows) or `setup-demo.sh` (Mac/Linux)
2. **Practice 2-3 times** with the flow above
3. **Open ScreenToGif** and set up recording area
4. **Take a deep breath** and record your masterpiece!
