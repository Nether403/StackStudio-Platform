  toolCount: number;
}

## Responsive Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: `< 640px` - Single column layout
- **Tablet**: `640px - 1024px` - Two column layout
- **Desktop**: `> 1024px` - Three column layout

## Usage

### Basic Implementation

```tsx
import ResponsiveDashboard from '../components/ResponsiveDashboard';

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return <ResponsiveDashboard />;
}
```

### With SSR Disabled (Recommended)

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const ResponsiveDashboard = dynamic(
  () => import('../components/ResponsiveDashboard'),
  { ssr: false }
);

export default function DashboardPage() {
  return <ResponsiveDashboard />;
}
```

## Styling

The component uses:
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive utilities and styling
- **Custom CSS animations** in `styles/responsive-dashboard.css`
- **CSS-in-JS** alternatives avoided for better performance

### Custom Animations

```css
@keyframes fade-in {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(10px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```
