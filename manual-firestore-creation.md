# Manual Firestore Database Creation Guide

## ðŸš¨ **Current Issue**
The workflow is still failing with Error Code 5 (NOT_FOUND) because the Firestore database doesn't exist and the service account can't create it automatically.

## âœ… **Manual Solution (Fastest)**
You need to manually create the Firestore database in your Google Cloud project.

### Step 1: Open Google Cloud Console
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore?project=sunny-furnace-461114-s9
2. Make sure you're in the correct project: `sunny-furnace-461114-s9`

### Step 2: Create Firestore Database
1. You should see a "Create Database" button
2. Click "Create Database"
3. Choose "Firestore in Native mode" (NOT Datastore mode)
4. Select a region (recommend: `us-central1`)
5. Click "Create Database"

### Step 3: Wait for Database Creation
- The database creation takes 1-2 minutes
- You'll see a loading screen

### Step 4: Verify Database Created
- Once created, you'll see the Firestore console
- The database should show as "(default)"

### Step 5: Test the Workflow
Once the database is created, trigger the workflow again:

```bash
# Make a small change to trigger the workflow
echo "Test: Database created manually" >> Database/ai_models_and_apis.json
git add Database/ai_models_and_apis.json
git commit -m "Test: Trigger workflow after manual Firestore database creation"
git push origin master
```

## ðŸ”§ **Alternative: Grant Service Account Permissions**
If you want automatic database creation to work, grant these permissions:

```bash
# Grant permission to create Firestore databases
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding sunny-furnace-461114-s9 \
    --member="serviceAccount:stackfast-github-actions@sunny-furnace-461114-s9.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/datastore.owner"

# Grant permission to manage services
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding sunny-furnace-461114-s9 \
    --member="serviceAccount:stackfast-github-actions@sunny-furnace-461114-s9.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
    --role="roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Result**
After creating the Firestore database manually:
1. âœ… Authentication will work (already working)
2. âœ… JSON parsing will work (already fixed)
3. âœ… Firestore connection will work (database now exists)
4. âœ… Database sync will complete successfully
