*StackFast is an intelligent assistant designed to accelerate the journey from idea to execution. Describe your project, and StackFast will generate a tailored technology stack, a cost projection, an initial project plan, and even create a GitHub repository for you.*

<!-- 
üé¨ GIF Creation Guide:
For the demo GIF, I recommend showing:
1. User entering project details in the wizard
2. AI generating recommendations 
3. Cost projection appearing
4. GitHub repo creation
5. Final dashboard view

Tools to create the GIF:
- LICEcap (free, cross-platform): https://www.cockos.com/licecap/
- ScreenToGif (Windows): https://www.screentogif.com/
- Kap (macOS): https://getkap.co/
- Or record with OBS and convert to GIF

Optimal specs: 800-1000px width, <3MB size, 10-15 seconds
Upload to: GitHub releases, Imgur, or your own CDN
