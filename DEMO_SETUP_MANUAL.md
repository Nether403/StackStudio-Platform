# StackFast Demo Setup - Manual Instructions

## ðŸš¨ **If the setup scripts don't work, follow these manual steps:**

### **Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended)**

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\MartinGfX\OneDrive\Documenten\StackFast powered by StackStudio"
   ```

2. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open Browser**
   - Open a new browser window
   - Go to: `http://localhost:3000`
   - **Use incognito/private mode** (important!)

4. **Setup Recording**
   - Download ScreenToGif: https://www.screentogif.com/
   - Set window size to about 1200x800 pixels
   - Close unnecessary tabs and windows

### **Option 2: PowerShell Script**

Run this instead of the .bat file:
```powershell
.\setup-demo.ps1
```

### **Option 3: Step-by-Step Commands**

Open PowerShell and run these one by one:

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "C:\Users\MartinGfX\OneDrive\Documenten\StackFast powered by StackStudio"

# Check you're in the right place
dir package.json

# Start dev server (this will keep running)
npm run dev
```

Then in a **new terminal/browser**:
```powershell
# Open browser to your app
start http://localhost:3000
```
