## üîß Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
Vercel is the easiest option for Next.js applications with automatic deployments.

### Option 2: Firebase Hosting
Firebase Hosting integrates well with your existing Firebase setup.

### Option 3: Custom Cloud Deployment
Use your WIF setup for custom Google Cloud deployment.

## üåê Deployment Steps

### 1. Run WIF Setup
Execute your PowerShell script to set up authentication:
```powershell
.\setup-wif.ps1
```

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets
Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository at:
`https://github.com/miasamura/StackFast-By-StackStudio-MVP-/settings/secrets/actions`

**WIF Secrets** (from setup-wif.ps1 output):
- `GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`
- `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`
- `GCP_PROJECT_ID`

**Environment Secrets**:
- `NEXTAUTH_URL` - Your production URL
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Random secret for NextAuth.js
- `GITHUB_ID` - GitHub OAuth App ID
- `GITHUB_SECRET` - GitHub OAuth App Secret
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` - Firebase API key
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` - Firebase auth domain
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Firebase project ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` - Firebase storage bucket
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` - Firebase messaging sender ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID` - Firebase app ID
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` - Server-side Firebase project ID
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` - Service account email
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` - Service account private key

**Deployment Platform Secrets** (choose one):

**For Vercel:**
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - Vercel deployment token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` - Vercel organization ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` - Vercel project ID

**For Firebase Hosting:**
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` - Firebase service account JSON

### 3. Configure Your Deployment Platform

#### Vercel Setup
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Login: `vercel login`
3. Initialize project: `vercel`
4. Get org and project IDs: `vercel ls`

#### Firebase Hosting Setup
1. Install Firebase CLI: `npm install -g firebase-tools`
2. Login: `firebase login`
3. Initialize hosting: `firebase init hosting`
4. Select your Firebase project

### 4. Deploy
Push to your main branch to trigger automatic deployment:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy StackFast to production"
git push origin main
```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Check Deployment Status
Monitor your GitHub Actions workflow for successful deployment.

### 2. Test Core Features
- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Blueprint generation
- [ ] Blueprint saving and loading
- [ ] GitHub repository creation
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile/desktop

### 3. Monitor Performance
- Check load times and responsiveness
- Monitor Firebase usage and costs
- Verify GitHub integration works for new users

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Authentication Errors:**
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Check Firebase project configuration
- Ensure GitHub OAuth app is configured correctly

**Deployment Failures:**
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify WIF setup is correct
- Ensure all secrets are properly configured

**GitHub Integration Issues:**
- Confirm OAuth app has correct permissions
- Check callback URLs match your domain
- Verify users can authenticate with GitHub

## üìà Production Monitoring

### Firebase Console
- Monitor Firestore usage and security rules
- Check Authentication usage
- Review Firebase Functions logs (if using)

### GitHub Actions
- Monitor deployment success/failure
- Check workflow run times
- Review build logs for errors

### Application Performance
- Monitor user authentication success rates
- Track blueprint generation and GitHub integration usage
- Monitor API response times

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

Your GitHub Actions workflow is configured to:
1. **Test** on every push and PR
2. **Deploy** automatically on main branch pushes
3. **Verify** build and type checking
4. **Sync** database if needed

## üéØ Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Share with users** - Your MVP is ready for real users!
2. **Monitor usage** - Track how users interact with the platform
3. **Collect feedback** - Gather user feedback for improvements
4. **Scale features** - Add AI integration and sharing features

## üìä Success Metrics to Track

- User registration and retention rates
- Blueprint generation success rates
- GitHub repository creation rates
- User session duration
- Feature adoption rates
