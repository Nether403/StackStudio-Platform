Product Requirements Document: StackFast
Version: 1.0
Date: July 7, 2025
Author: StackFast (powered by StackStudio)
Status: Draft 
1. Introduction & Vision
Vision Statement: To eliminate the friction in starting new software projects by providing developers and entrepreneurs with instant, intelligent, and actionable technology stack recommendations and development roadmaps.
Summary: StackFast is a SaaS application designed to cure the "analysis paralysis" that plagues modern development. By leveraging a sophisticated compatibility engine and AI, it transforms a user's project idea into a complete, validated technology stack and a step-by-step project plan. We are not just a recommendation tool; we are a project accelerator, empowering builders to go from idea to execution with confidence and speed.
2. The Problem
The "Research Slog": Developers spend countless hours, often weeks, researching and debating the "perfect" technology stack. This process is fraught with challenges:
* Information Overload: The landscape of frameworks, libraries, and services is vast and constantly changing.
* Compatibility Nightmares: Ensuring tools work well together is a complex, error-prone task.
* Analysis Paralysis: The fear of making a suboptimal choice leads to indecision and delays, killing momentum before a single line of code is written.
The Consequence: Valuable time and creative energy are wasted on pre-project deliberation instead of active building and innovation.
3. Target Audience
* Solo Developers & Indie Hackers: Individuals who need to move quickly and don't have a team to help with architectural decisions. They value efficiency and direct paths to a viable product.
* Startup Founders (Technical & Non-Technical): Entrepreneurs who need to build and launch an MVP quickly to test market fit. They need a plan that is both technically sound and resource-efficient.
* Product Managers & Team Leads: Professionals within larger organizations tasked with spinning up new projects or prototypes. They need to de-risk technical choices and provide their teams with a clear starting point.
4. Goals & Objectives (Version 1.0 - MVP)
* Primary Goal: Validate the core value proposition: that users will find significant value in an automated stack recommendation and roadmap generation tool.
* Key Objectives:
1. Reduce Time-to-First-Line-of-Code: Decrease the user's research phase from weeks to minutes.
2. Increase User Confidence: Provide recommendations that are perceived as credible, intelligent, and trustworthy.
3. Achieve High User Activation: Ensure a frictionless onboarding experience where a user can input an idea and receive a full roadmap in a single session.
5. Features & Requirements
5.1. Core Feature: The StackFast Engine
* FR-1.1: Project Idea Input: A clean, simple text input field where the user describes their project idea (e.g., "a subscription-based newsletter platform with a recommendation engine").
* FR-1.2: Tool Advisory Engine:
o The system shall analyze the user's input against a proprietary database of tool profiles (backend, frontend, database, AI/ML services, etc.).
o The engine will use a compatibility scoring system to evaluate and rank potential tool combinations based on factors like integration ease, performance, and community support.
o The user shall be able to specify preferred tools or constraints (e.g., "must use React for the frontend").
* FR-1.3: Optimized Stack Recommendation: The system will present a single, primary recommended stack, complete with a "Compatibility Score" and a brief justification for why this stack is optimal for the described project.
* FR-1.4: Project Roadmap Generation:
o Upon accepting the recommended stack, the system will generate a detailed, step-by-step project plan.
o This plan will be broken down into logical phases (e.g., "Phase 1: Project Setup & Authentication," "Phase 2: Database Schema & API Endpoints").
o Each step will include actionable tasks and, where applicable, copy-ready prompts for AI coding assistants (e.g., "Prompt for Gemini: Write the Firebase security rules for...").
5.2. User Experience & Interface
* FR-2.1: User Authentication: Simple email/password and Google OAuth login via Firebase Authentication.
* FR-2.2: Dashboard: A central hub for users to view their saved projects and generated roadmaps.
* FR-2.3: Responsive Design: The interface must be fully functional and aesthetically pleasing on desktop and mobile devices.
6. Design & UX Principles
The UI will be a direct reflection of our brand: confident, clever, and efficient. It gets out of the user's way and provides immediate value.
1. Bold Simplicity: A clear, intuitive path from idea to roadmap. No distractions.
2. Breathable Whitespace: Ample negative space to reduce cognitive load and enhance focus on the content.
3. Strategic Color Accents: A neutral, high-contrast palette with purposeful use of color to guide attention to key actions and information.
4. Typography Hierarchy: Clear distinction between headings, body text, and code/prompt elements to ensure scannability.
5. Motion Choreography: Subtle, physics-based transitions to create a fluid and responsive feel, reinforcing the user's sense of control and progress.
6. Content-First Layout: The layout is built around the user's goal. Every element serves the primary task of generating a roadmap.
7. Technical Stack & Architecture (Proposed)
* Frontend: React (using Vite for speed), Tailwind CSS for styling.
* Backend/Authentication: Firebase (Firestore for database, Firebase Authentication for users).
* AI/LLM Integration: Google Gemini API (for natural language understanding of the project idea and prompt generation).
* Hosting: Vercel or Netlify for seamless deployment and scalability.
8. Monetization (Freemium Model)
* Free Tier: 1-2 free projects per user. Provides full access to the core engine to showcase value.
* Maker Plan (Paid): Aimed at individuals. Offers unlimited projects, advanced customization options, and the ability to save/export roadmaps.
* Studio Plan (Paid): Aimed at teams/agencies. Includes all Maker features plus team collaboration, shared projects, and priority support.
9. Success Metrics (First 6 Months Post-Launch)
* Activation Rate: % of new signups who successfully generate at least one full roadmap. (Target: >60%)
* Conversion Rate: % of active free users who upgrade to a paid plan. (Target: >4%)
* User Engagement: Number of roadmaps generated per user per month.
* User Satisfaction (Qualitative): Feedback gathered through surveys and interviews on the quality and actionability of the recommendations.
10. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)
* Deeper Tool Integration: Direct API integrations to scaffold projects automatically in a user's GitHub repository.
* Community-Sourced Data: Allowing the community to suggest new tools and review compatibility.
* Cost & Performance Analysis: Integrating cloud cost estimators into the stack recommendations.
* Expanded Tool Database: Broadening the scope beyond web apps to include mobile, game development, and IoT.
