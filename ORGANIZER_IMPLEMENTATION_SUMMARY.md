## 🎯 **Task Generation Algorithm**

### **Smart Task Creation**
```typescript
// Example task generation logic
const generateTasksFromBlueprint = (blueprintData) => {
  // 1. Planning Tasks
  - Research project requirements
  - Design system architecture
  
  // 2. Setup Tasks (per tool)
  - Configure [ToolName] for [Category]
  - Set up development environment
  
  // 3. Development Tasks
  - Implement core functionality
  - Create user interface
  
  // 4. Testing Tasks
  - Write unit tests
  - Perform integration testing
  
  // 5. Deployment Tasks
  - Set up CI/CD pipeline
  - Deploy to production
};
```
