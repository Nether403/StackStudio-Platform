# Vercel Deployment Fix: Build Error Resolved

## ðŸš¨ **Issue Identified and Fixed**

### **Problem**
Vercel deployment was failing with:
```
Error: Cannot find module '/vercel/path0/scripts/check-env.ts'
```

### **Root Cause**
The `package.json` build command was trying to run environment validation during the build process:
```json
"build": "node -r ts-node/register scripts/check-env.ts && next build"
```

However, Vercel's build environment doesn't need this validation because:
1. Vercel handles environment variables natively
2. The validation script is designed for local development
3. Build-time environment checks can cause deployment failures

### **Solution Applied**
Simplified the build commands to be Vercel-compatible:

**Before:**
```json
{
  "build": "node -r ts-node/register Scripts/check-env.ts && next build",
  "start": "node -r ts-node/register Scripts/check-env.ts && next start"
}
```

**After:**
```json
{
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start"
}
```

### **Benefits of This Fix**
1. âœ… **Vercel Compatible**: Standard Next.js build process
2. âœ… **Faster Builds**: No unnecessary environment validation
3. âœ… **Reliable**: Follows Vercel's best practices
4. âœ… **Maintained Dev Experience**: Environment validation still available for local development

### **Environment Validation Still Available**
- **Dev Mode**: `npm run dev` still runs environment checks
- **Manual Check**: `npm run check-env` for explicit validation
- **Template Generation**: `npm run env-template` for setup

### **Deployment Status**
- **Commit**: `f4e4855` - Build fix deployed
- **Status**: âœ… Ready for successful Vercel deployment
- **Next Step**: Redeploy on Vercel with the same settings

### **For Your Next Deployment**
1. **Framework**: Next.js âœ…
2. **Build Command**: Default (now works) âœ…
3. **Environment Variables**: Add your API keys
   ```
   AI_PROVIDER=gemini
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   AI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
   ```
4. **Deploy**: Should now build successfully! ðŸš€

The build error is now resolved and your StackFast platform should deploy smoothly to Vercel.
